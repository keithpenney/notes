Regular Expressions (Regex) Notes (specific to Python re module)

Matching Characters
  .
    Generic Character. Matches any character except a newline (i.e. [^\n])

  ^
    Matches only at the beginning of a line.  Note, if multi-line mode is
    supported, will also match a string immediately following a newline char.
    Examples:
      ^From will match 'From' only if it occurs at the beginning of a line.
    Alternate definition: Set complement (only within a character set [^...])

  $
    Matches only at the end of a line (i.e. the last char of a string, or
    immediately before a newline char).
    Examples:
      to$ will match 'to' only if it occurs at the end of a line.

  *
    Specifies that the previous character can occur zero or more times.
    Examples:
      ca*t will match 'cat', 'ct', 'caaaaaaat', etc...

  +
    Specifies that the previous character can occur one or more times.
    Examples:
      ca+t will match 'cat', 'caaat', 'caaaaaat', etc... but not 'ct'

  ?
    Specifies that the previous character can occur zero times or one time.
    Examples:
      ca?t will match only 'cat' and 'ct' (not 'caat', etc...)

  {}
    Specifies that the previous character must occur a number of times within
    the given range.
    Note: if we do not specify a value, default values are assumed.   I.e.
    {3,} is equivalent to {3,infinity}
    {,3} is equivalent to {0,3}
    Examples:
      ca{1,3}t will match 'cat', 'caat', and 'caaat', but not 'ct', or 'caaaat', etc...
      
  []
    Character Class. Defines a set of matching characters.
    Metacharacters (matching characters) are not active inside a character class.
    Examples:
      [ABC] will match 'A', 'B', or 'C'
      [A-C] will match 'A', 'B', or 'C'
      [z3$] will match 'z', '3', or '$' ($ is no longer a metacharacter)
      [^123] will match any single character except '1', '2', or '3'
      [12^3] will match '1', '2', '^', or '3'

  \
    Escape Character.  Can be used to specify special pre-defined sets or to
    escape the meaning of a metacharacter.
    Special Matching Classes:
      Code  Behavior                            Equivalent Character Class
      ----  --------                            --------------------------
      \d    Matches any decimal digit           [0-9]
      \D    Matches any non-digit character     [^0-9]
      \s    Matches any whitespace character    [ \t\n\r\f\v]
      \S    Matches any non-whitespace char     [^ \t\n\r\f\v]
      \w    Matches any alphanumeric character  [a-zA-Z0-9_]
      \W    Matches any non-alphanumeric char   [^a-zA-Z0-9_]
      

  |
    Logical OR Operator.  Specifies that a string matches a patter if it matches
    one of two sub-patterns logically OR'd with this operator.
    Examples:
      dog|cat will match 'dog' or 'cat' and nothing else

  ()
    Grouping.  Combines an expression into a sub-expression which can be nested
    or combined with other expressions.

Zero-Width Assertions:
  These characters match a position within a string without consuming a character.
  Thus, the same zero-width assertion should never be repeated (because if it
  matches once, it will match agagin).

  \A
    Matches at the start of a string.

  \Z
    Matches at the end of a string.

  \b
    Matches at a word boundary.
    NOTE! In Python, you must use 'raw' strings to allow use of this assertion
    since it collides with Python's 'backspace' escape character.
    Example:
      \bface\b will match "is my face ok?" but will not match "surface effacement"

  \B
    The opposite of \b.  Only matches when not at a word boundary.

Capture Groups:
---------------
  If we want to not only match a particular line of text but to extract a substring
  from a matching line, we can use 'capture groups'.  We simply place parentheses ()
  around the portion of the regex pattern that we want to match and a re.match object
  will contain the n'th matching substring as match.group(n).

  E.g.:
    test = re.compile("My name is (\w+) and I am (\w+) years old.")
    m = test.match("My name is Marbles and I am 200 years old.")
    if m:
        print(m.group(0))   # Prints the entire matching string
        print(m.group(1))   # Prints 'Marbles'
        print(m.group(2))   # Prints '200'
